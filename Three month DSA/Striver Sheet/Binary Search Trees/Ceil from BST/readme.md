4
8 5 10 2 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 7 -1 -1
7
Sample Output 1:

7
Explanation For Sample Output 1:
 In the first test case, we traverse the tree starting from the root node which has a value of 8. Now the value of its left child is 5 and its right child is 10. Key-value 4 is less than the left child so we traverse the left subtree. Now we reach a node with value 5 and then again repeat the above process till we reach a null node. Finally, we return 5 as our answer.

In the second test case, we traverse the tree starting from the root node which has a value of 8. Now the value of its left child is 5 and its right child is 10. Key-value 7 is less than the right child and more than the left child, so we traverse the right subtree. Now we reach a node with value 10 and then again follow the same procedure and reach a node with value 7 and stop there and return 7 as our final answer.
