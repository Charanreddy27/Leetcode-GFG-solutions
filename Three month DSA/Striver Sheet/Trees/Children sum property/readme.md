Problem Statement: Children Sum Property in a Binary Tree. Write a program that converts any binary tree to one that follows the children sum property.

The children sum property is defined as, For every node of the tree, the value of a node is equal to the sum of values of its children(left child and right child).

Note: 

The node values can be increased by 1 any number of times but decrement of any node value is not allowed.
A value for a NULL node can be assumed as 0.
You are not allowed to change the structure of the given binary tree.
